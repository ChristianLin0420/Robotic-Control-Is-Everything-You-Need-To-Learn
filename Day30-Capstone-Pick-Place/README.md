# Day 30: Capstone - Pick and Place with Language Goals

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Build complete pick-and-place system with language goals
- Integrate camera, encoder, policy, and controller
- Implement reproducible evaluation pipeline
- Create comprehensive ablation study

## 📚 Background
This is the capstone project that brings together everything learned over 30 days. We'll build a complete system that can understand natural language instructions and perform pick-and-place tasks.
