- Build CBF and reachability-based safety
- Test robustness under perturbations
- Create comprehensive safety evaluation

## 📚 Background
Advanced policies like Diffusion Policy and VLA models need robust safety mechanisms. Today we'll implement action shields and test robustness under various failure modes.

## 📝 Mathematical Background

### Action Shield
```
a_safe = Shield(a_policy, s)
```

Where Shield ensures safety constraints.

### CBF Safety
```
min ||a - a_policy||²
s.t. ḣ(x) + α(h(x)) ≥ 0
```

### Reachability Safety
```
a_safe ∈ SafeActions(s, horizon)
```

Where SafeActions is the reachable safe set.
