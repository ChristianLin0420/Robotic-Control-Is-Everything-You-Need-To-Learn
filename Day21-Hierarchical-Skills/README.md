# Day 21: Hierarchical Skills

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Implement hierarchical skill learning
- Build options framework with high-level and low-level policies
- Understand skill composition and reuse
- Apply to complex multi-step tasks

## 📚 Background
Hierarchical learning decomposes complex tasks into simpler skills. By learning reusable skills and a high-level policy to select them, we can tackle more complex tasks efficiently.

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Options Framework** (`hierarchical/options_framework.py`):
   - Option definition and execution
   - Skill termination conditions
   - High-level policy interface
   - Skill composition logic

2. **Skill Learner** (`hierarchical/skill_learner.py`):
   - Individual skill training
   - Skill-specific rewards
   - Skill evaluation metrics
   - Skill reuse strategies

3. **High-Level Policy** (`hierarchical/high_level_policy.py`):
   - Skill selection policy
   - Task decomposition
   - Skill sequencing
   - Multi-task learning

4. **Skill Composition** (`hierarchical/skill_composer.py`):
   - Combine multiple skills
   - Handle skill transitions
   - Error recovery
   - Success rate evaluation

### Key Features to Implement

- **Skill Decomposition**: Break tasks into skills
- **Skill Reuse**: Use skills across tasks
- **Hierarchical Control**: High-level skill selection
- **Skill Composition**: Combine skills for complex tasks
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Learn skills for multiple tasks

## 🎮 Demo Task
Implement hierarchical skills for CALVIN tasks:

### Skills to Learn
1. **Reach Skill**: Move arm to target position
2. **Grasp Skill**: Grasp object with gripper
3. **Place Skill**: Place object at target location

### Tasks
1. **Pick and Place**: Reach → Grasp → Place
2. **Open Drawer**: Reach → Grasp → Pull
3. **Turn On Light**: Reach → Grasp → Turn

### Training Protocol
1. Train individual skills on sub-tasks
2. Train high-level policy for skill selection
3. Evaluate skill composition on complex tasks
4. Measure skill reuse efficiency
5. Test multi-task generalization

## 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] Individual skills work independently
- [ ] High-level policy selects correct skills
- [ ] Skill composition achieves complex tasks
- [ ] Skills are reusable across tasks
- [ ] Clear improvement over flat learning

## 🔧 Dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install calvin
pip install wandb tensorboard
pip install matplotlib seaborn
pip install numpy scipy
```

## 📝 Mathematical Background

### Options Framework
An option is defined as:
```
o = (I, π, β)
```

Where:
- I is the initiation set
- π is the option policy
- β is the termination condition

### High-Level Policy
```
π_high(s) = argmax_a Q_high(s, a)
```

Where a represents skill selection.

### Skill Composition
```
π_composed(s) = π_skill_i(s) if skill_i active
```

## 📝 Deliverables
- Complete hierarchical skills framework
- Individual skill implementations
- High-level policy learning
- Skill composition evaluation
- Multi-task success analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps
Tomorrow we start Week 4 with advanced methods - Diffusion Policy!
