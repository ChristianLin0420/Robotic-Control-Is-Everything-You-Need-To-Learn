# Day 27: Model-Based RL at Scale

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Implement trajectory-sampling PETS
- Build Dreamer-V3-lite for manipulation
- Understand latent dynamics modeling
- Compare sample efficiency with SAC

## 📚 Background
Model-based RL learns a model of the environment dynamics and uses it for planning. This can significantly improve sample efficiency compared to model-free methods.

## 📝 Mathematical Background

### PETS
Learn ensemble of dynamics models:
```
f_θ_i(s_t, a_t) = s_{t+1} + ε_i
```

Plan by sampling trajectories:
```
τ ~ p(τ|s_0, a_0, ..., a_T, f_θ)
```

### Dreamer-V3-lite
Learn latent dynamics:
```
z_t = Encoder(s_t)
z_{t+1} = Dynamics(z_t, a_t)
s_{t+1} = Decoder(z_{t+1})
```

Train actor-critic in latent space:
```
L_actor = -E[Q(z_t, a_t)]
L_critic = E[(Q(z_t, a_t) - r_t - γV(z_{t+1}))²]
```

## 📝 Deliverables
